## sport-booker
`sport-booker` allows a bad-ass padel or squash player to book its desired schedule to play with his friends (or ennemies). There is more : you can choose your sport and it can be used automatically

This project is just an example of automated booking procedure, but it can be extended to other purposes.

Book your schedule directly : `booker-auto-cli`
